# NLP-Shakespeare-AI
A small python notebook exploring how to use Natural Language Processing and Recurrent Neural Network architecture to train a model on a specific text such that it can sucessfully predict missing letters in a word. Example [h,e,l,l,_] and the model will predict "o" to complete "hello". In this case th emodel has been trained to predict & generate shakespeare texts.
